- **Backstory**: Context and experience that guides behavior
- **Tool Access**: Available tools and capabilities
- **Execution History**: Track of tasks performed and results
- **Analytics**: Performance metrics and usage tracking

### Agent Types

```python
class AgentType(Enum):
    MANAGER = "manager"
    RESEARCH = "research"
    WRITER = "writer"
    EDITOR = "editor"
```

### Base Agent Structure

```python
class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str, role: str, goal: str, backstory: str, 
                 agent_type: AgentType, tools: List[str]):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role
        self.goal = goal
        self.backstory = backstory
        self.agent_type = agent_type

   - Optimal section sequence determination
   - Introduction/conclusion placement
   - Information hierarchy optimization
   - Reader engagement flow
   - Structural improvement suggestions

##### Processing Framework

```python
def manage_continuity(self, context: ProcessingContext) -> ProcessingResult:
    # Extract sections from metadata or derive from content
    sections = context.metadata.get('sections', {})
    if not sections:
        sections = self._naive_split_into_sections(context.content)
    
    # Convert to structured section format
    structured_sections = self._convert_to_section_types(sections)
    
    # Perform continuity validation
    continuity_report = self.validator.validate_newsletter_continuity(structured_sections)
    
    # Generate improvement suggestions
    suggestions = []
    if continuity_report.transition_quality_score < 0.65:
        suggestions.append("Consider smoothing transitions between sections")
    
    if continuity_report.overall_continuity_score < 0.7:
        suggestions.append("Evaluate section order for improved flow")
    
    # Propose optimal section ordering
    proposed_order = self._propose_section_order(list(structured_sections.keys()))
    
    return ProcessingResult(
        quality_score=continuity_report.overall_continuity_score,
        confidence_score=continuity_report.overall_continuity_score,
        suggestions=suggestions,
        metadata={
            'continuity_report': continuity_report.to_dict(),
            'proposed_order': [s.value for s in proposed_order]
        }
    )
```

##### Continuity Metrics

**Overall Continuity Score Calculation**:
- Narrative flow: 30% weight
- Style consistency: 25% weight
- Transition quality: 25% weight
- Redundancy score: 20% weight

**Quality Thresholds**:
- Excellent (0.9+): Seamless narrative flow
- Good (0.8-0.9): Strong continuity with minor issues
- Fair (0.7-0.8): Adequate flow with some improvements needed
- Poor (<0.7): Significant continuity issues requiring attention

**Section Ordering Principles**:
- Introduction sections first
- Conclusion sections last
- Analysis sections in logical progression
- Tutorial sections with proper prerequisites

## Multi-Agent Orchestration

Phase 2 introduces the `AgentCoordinator` system that manages the execution of specialized agents with sophisticated dependency handling, performance monitoring, and error recovery.

### Agent Coordinator

#### Core Responsibilities

**Orchestration Management**:
- Multi-agent execution pipeline coordination
- Dependency resolution and scheduling
- Parallel and sequential execution optimization
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Error handling and recovery

#### Coordination Framework

```python
@dataclass
class AgentExecutionSpec:
    name: str
    agent: BaseSpecializedAgent
    depends_on: List[str]  # Agent dependencies

class AgentCoordinator:
    def execute_pipeline(self, specs: List[AgentExecutionSpec], 
                        context: ProcessingContext) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Execute agents in dependency order
        # Monitor performance and collect metrics
        # Handle failures with circuit breaker patterns
        # Aggregate results and provide final output
```

#### Performance Optimization

**Dynamic Mode Switching**:
- Full processing for high-quality requirements
- Fast processing for time-constrained scenarios
- Fallback processing for reliability

**Health Monitoring**:
- Agent status tracking (healthy, degraded, failed)
- Performance metrics collection
- Circuit breaker state management
- Automatic recovery mechanisms

**Execution Metrics**:
- Total execution time tracking
- Individual agent performance
- Success/failure rates
- Quality score aggregation

#### Error Handling Strategies

**Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
- Failure threshold monitoring (default: 5 failures)
- Recovery timeout management (default: 60 seconds)
- Automatic state transitions (closed → open → half-open)
- Health check integration

**Dependency Management**:
- Missing dependency detection
- Failed dependency handling
- Alternative execution paths
- Graceful degradation

**Fallback Mechanisms**:
- Agent-specific fallback processing
- Minimal functionality preservation
- Original content preservation
- Error context reporting

### Integration with Workflow Orchestrator

The Phase 2 agents integrate seamlessly with the existing `WorkflowOrchestrator` through feature flagging:

```python
# Phase 2: Multi-Agent Specialized Validation (feature-flagged)
if os.getenv('ENABLE_PHASE2', '1') == '1':
    multi_agent_results = self._execute_multi_agent_phase(
        content, writing_result
    )
    # Use improved content if available
    final_content = multi_agent_results.get('final_content', original_content)
```

**Integration Benefits**:
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Optional enhancement activation
- Performance monitoring integration
- Seamless quality improvement

## Agent Coordination

### Hierarchical Workflow Execution

The agents work together in a coordinated workflow:

1. **Manager Agent**: Creates workflow plan and assigns tasks
2. **Research Agent**: Gathers and validates information
3. **Writer Agent**: Creates structured content with code examples
4. **Editor Agent**: Reviews, validates, and provides feedback
5. **Manager Agent**: Handles feedback and coordinates revisions

### Communication Patterns

#### Manager → Agents
- Task assignment with context
- Quality requirements specification
- Deadline and priority setting
- Resource allocation

#### Agent → Manager
- Task completion reporting
- Issue escalation
- Resource requests
- Progress updates

#### Editor → Writer (via Manager)
- Structured feedback delivery
- Revision requirements
- Quality improvement suggestions
- Approval or rejection decisions

### State Management

```python
@dataclass
class ExecutionState:
    workflow_id: str
    current_phase: str
    revision_cycles: Dict[str, int]
    quality_scores: List[float]
    task_results: List[TaskResult]
    feedback_history: List[Dict]
```

### Error Handling and Recovery

**Agent Failure Recovery**:
- Automatic retry with backoff
- Alternative agent assignment
- Graceful degradation
- Error reporting and logging

**Quality Gate Failures**:
- Structured feedback generation
- Revision cycle initiation
- Escalation procedures
- Quality threshold adjustment

## Campaign Context Integration

### Context Structure

```python
@dataclass
class CampaignContext:
    campaign_id: str
    audience_persona: Dict[str, Any]
    content_style: Dict[str, Any]
    strategic_goals: List[str]
    quality_thresholds: Dict[str, float]
    preferred_terminology: List[str]
