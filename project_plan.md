# AI Multi-Agent Newsletter System Architecture

## System Overview

A multi-agent AI system designed to autonomously research, plan, write, and review newsletters on cutting-edge AI topics with human oversight.

---

## Agentic RAG Approach (New)

The system will adopt an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture, where autonomous agents collaborate to iteratively refine queries, retrieve and synthesize information from multiple sources, critique and improve responses, and maintain state/memory across interactions. This approach enables more robust, accurate, and context-aware content generation.

### Key Agentic RAG Features
- **Agent State & Memory:** Each agent maintains memory of past queries, responses, and context.
- **Self-Critique & Feedback Loops:** Agents evaluate and improve their own outputs.
- **Multi-Source & Multi-Hop Retrieval:** Agents can retrieve and merge information from vector DB, web, and other sources.
- **Dynamic Tool Selection & Chaining:** Agents select and chain retrieval tools based on query needs.
- **Uncertainty Estimation & Escalation:** Agents estimate confidence and escalate to humans if needed.
- **Agent Collaboration & Specialization:** Specialized agents can delegate or collaborate on tasks.
- **Logging, Monitoring, and Analytics:** All agent actions and decisions are logged for transparency and improvement.
- **User Feedback Integration:** User feedback is collected and used to improve agent performance.
- **Iteration Control:** The system limits iterations and gracefully exits or escalates when needed.
- **Extensibility:** Modular, plugin-based agent and tool framework for future growth.

### Open Source, Local-First Tools & Frameworks
- **LLMs:** Ollama (Llama 2, Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.)
- **Vector DB:** ChromaDB, FAISS (optional)
- **Embeddings:** Sentence-Transformers
- **Agent Framework:** Custom Python, FastAPI, asyncio
- **Web Search:** DuckDuckGo Search (duckduckgo-search)
- **NLP:** NLTK, spaCy
- **Scraping:** Scrapy
- **Logging/Monitoring:** Python logging, Prometheus, Grafana (optional)
- **State/Storage:** SQLite, Redis (optional)
- **Testing:** Pytest

All tools are open source, free, and can run locally.

## Agentic RAG Workflow (New)

1. **Query Rewriting:** QueryWriterAgent refines the user query.
2. **Context Assessment:** ContextAssessmentAgent decides if more context is needed.
3. **Source Selection:** SourceSelectorAgent chooses and queries the best sources (vector DB, web, etc.).
4. **Prompt Construction:** PromptBuilder assembles the final prompt for the LLM.
5. **LLM Generation:** LLM generates a response.
6. **Response Evaluation:** ResponseEvaluatorAgent critiques the response for relevance and quality.
7. **Iteration & Control:** If the answer is insufficient, the process iterates with updated queries/context, up to a set limit.
8. **Escalation:** If confidence remains low, escalate to a human or return a fallback message.
9. **User Feedback:** Collect and store user feedback for future improvement.
