- `dev/phase4_implementation_summary.md` - This summary document

## Test Command
```bash
python dev/test_phase4.py
```

## Current Status
Phase 4 is **functional but needs refinement**. The system architecture is solid, but some components need improvement in their validation algorithms to achieve the desired accuracy levels.
