# Testing Plan: Phase 1.1 – Vector Database & RAG System Enhancement

## 1. Unit Tests

### a. Document Chunking
- **Test**: Input documents of various lengths and formats.
- **Assert**: Output chunks are within the expected size limits, no data loss, and all text is covered.
- **Edge Cases**: Very short/long documents, documents with only whitespace, non-UTF8 characters.

### b. Embedding Pipeline
- **Test**: Pass sample text and verify embeddings are generated (correct shape, dtype, non-zero).
- **Assert**: Embeddings are consistent for identical input, and different for different input.
- **Mock**: Use a mock embedding model for speed and determinism.

### c. Duplicate Detection
- **Test**: Insert duplicate and near-duplicate documents.
- **Assert**: Duplicates are detected and flagged/filtered; near-duplicates are handled per threshold.

### d. Temporal Relevance Scoring
- **Test**: Documents with various timestamps.
- **Assert**: Scoring reflects recency (e.g., newer docs have higher scores).

### e. Topic Clustering
- **Test**: Insert documents with clear topic separation.
- **Assert**: Clusters are formed as expected; documents in the same topic are grouped.

### f. Metadata Management
- **Test**: Store and retrieve documents with metadata (source, date, tags).
- **Assert**: Metadata is correctly saved, retrievable, and queryable.

### g. Semantic Search & Retrieval
- **Test**: Query with relevant/irrelevant terms.
- **Assert**: Relevant documents are ranked higher; irrelevant ones are not returned.

## 2. Integration Tests

### a. End-to-End Ingestion
- **Test**: Ingest a batch of raw documents through chunking, embedding, deduplication, and storage.
- **Assert**: All steps complete, and the final vector store contains the correct, deduplicated, chunked, and embedded documents.

### b. Retrieval with Filters
- **Test**: Query with semantic search and metadata filters (date, topic, source).
- **Assert**: Only documents matching both semantic and metadata criteria are returned.

### c. Update & Delete Operations
- **Test**: Update document content/metadata and delete documents.
- **Assert**: Changes are reflected in the store and retrieval results.

---

## 3. Performance Tests

### a. Scalability
- **Test**: Ingest and retrieve with 10,000+ documents.
- **Assert**: Ingestion and retrieval times are within success criteria (<2 seconds for retrieval).

### b. Memory & Resource Usage
- **Test**: Monitor memory/CPU during large batch operations.
- **Assert**: No memory leaks or excessive resource usage.

---

## 4. Regression & Edge Case Tests

- **Test**: Re-ingest already existing documents (should not create duplicates).
- **Test**: Ingest documents with missing/invalid metadata.
- **Test**: Search with empty or nonsensical queries.

---

## 5. Manual/Exploratory Testing

- Use a CLI or notebook to manually ingest, search, and inspect the vector store.
- Try unexpected inputs (binary files, HTML, etc.) to ensure robust error handling.

---

## 6. Test Automation & Coverage

- Use `pytest` for all unit/integration tests.
- Aim for >90% code coverage.
- Set up CI to run tests on every commit.

## Test File Structure Proposal

```
tests/
├── storage/
│   ├── test_vector_store.py
│   ├── test_document_store.py
│   ├── test_embedding_manager.py
│   └── test_retrieval_system.py
└── integration/
    └── test_vector_pipeline.py
```

## Success Criteria (from implementation plan)
- Vector database can store and retrieve 10,000+ documents
- Content deduplication achieves 95%+ accuracy
- Retrieval system responds in <2 seconds
